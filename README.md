# Instacart_Data_Analysis_Python
## Objective
The project focused on Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they wanted to uncover more information about their sales patterns. I performed an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the criteria they provided.

## Data
The data constituted of the following information
##### Orders
##### Customers
##### Products
##### Departments
##### Folders
## The basket analysis project was organized into five folders:

#### Project Management: Contains the Project Brief.
#### Data: Divided into Original and Prepared Data (not included here). Original Data holds raw dataframes, while Prepared Data contains cleaned and prepared dataframes for analysis.
#### Scripts: Includes all Python coding used for the analysis process.
#### Analysis: Holds visualizations used to derive insights for the final report.
####  Sent to Client: Contains the Final Report with key findings and recommendations.
